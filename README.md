educationdata
=============

Retrieve data from the Urban Institute's [Education Data API](https://ed-data-portal.urban.org/) as a `data.frame` for easy analysis.

Installation
------------

To install the alpha version of the package:

-   Clone the repository from GitHub.

`git clone https://github.com/UI-Research/education-data-package-r.git`

-   If you have RStudio installed, open `educationdata.Rproj` and build from source in the console. If you are using the R GUI, set your working directory to the project folder.

-   Install the `devtools` package if you don't already have it, and run:

``` r
# install.packages(devtools) # if necessary
devtools::install()
```

Endpoint Format
---------------

API endpoints follow a format of

-   `level/source/topic/{required}/{variables}/grouping/variables`

where:

-   `level` is the data level to query (i.e., schools, school-districts, college-university)
-   `source` is the data source for a specific level (i.e., ccd, ipeds, saipe)
-   `topic` is the data topic to query
-   `{required}/{variables}` are arguments that must be set for a specific topic
-   `grouping/variables` are arguments that will provide data 'by' certain categories

For example, the endpoint

-   `college-university/ipeds/fall-enrollment/{year}/{level_of_study}/`

will provide:

-   college-university level data
-   from IPEDS
-   on fall-enrollment numbers
-   for a specified year and level of study.

While the endpoint

-   `college-university/ipeds/fall-enrollment/{year}/{level_of_study}/race`

will provide the same data, grouped by race.

Usage
-----

Use the `get_education_data()` function to retrieve a `data.frame` from an API endpoint.

``` r
get_education_data(level, source, topic, ..., by, filters, add_labels)
```

The `get_education_data()` function will parse and validate several arguments against the API.

-   level - API data level to query. Current levels are:
    -   college-university
    -   school-districts
    -   schools
-   source - API data source to query. Current sources are:
    -   ccd
    -   ipeds
    -   saipe
-   topic - API data topic to query
-   ... - Additional parameters required for a specific API call
-   by - Additional optional parameters for a specific API call
-   filters - Optional query to filter the results from an API call
-   add\_labels - Add variable labels (when applicable)?

Examples
--------

Let's build up some examples, starting with a simple API endpoint:

-   `schools/ccd/enrollment/{year}/{grade}/`

In this case, the `level` is `schools`, the `source` is `ccd`, and the `topic` is `enrollment`. Note that variables in curly brackets (i.e., `year` and `grade`) are required for this endpoint.

``` r
df <- get_education_data(level = 'schools', 
                         source = 'ccd', 
                         topic = 'enrollment', 
                         year = 2004,
                         grade = 'grade-8')
```

The `year` parameter is vectorized and can accept multiple years:

``` r
df <- get_education_data(level = 'schools', 
                         source = 'ccd', 
                         topic = 'enrollment', 
                         year = 2004:2008,
                         grade = 'grade-8')
```

Or the endpoint can be called for 'all' `years`:

``` r
df <- get_education_data(level = 'schools', 
                         source = 'ccd', 
                         topic = 'enrollment', 
                         year = 'all',
                         grade = 'grade-8')
```

Note that this endpoint is also callable `by` certain variables:

-   `schools/ccd/enrollment/{year}/{grade}/race/`
-   `schools/ccd/enrollment/{year}/{grade}/sex/`
-   `schools/ccd/enrollment/{year}/{grade}/race/sex/`

These optional variables can be added to the `by` argument:

``` r
df <- get_education_data(level = 'schools', 
                         source = 'ccd', 
                         topic = 'enrollment', 
                         year = 2004,
                         grade = 'grade-8',
                         by = list('race', 'sex'))
```

You may also filter the results of an API call:

``` r
df <- get_education_data(level = 'schools', 
                         source = 'ccd', 
                         topic = 'enrollment', 
                         year = 2004,
                         grade = 'grade-8',
                         by = list('race', 'sex'),
                         filters = list('ncessch' = '010000200277'))
```

Finally, the `add_labels` flag will map variables to a `factor` from their labels in the API.

``` r
df <- get_education_data(level = 'schools', 
                         source = 'ccd', 
                         topic = 'enrollment', 
                         year = 2014,
                         grade = 'grade-8',
                         add_labels = TRUE)
```
