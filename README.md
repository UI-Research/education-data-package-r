educationdata
=============

[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/UrbanInstitute/education-data-package-r.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/UrbanInstitute/education-data-package-r)

Retrieve data from the Urban Institute's [Education Data API](https://ed-data-portal.urban.org/) as a `data.frame` for easy analysis.

**Note:** This package is still currently under **active** development. Please file all bugs, issues, and suggestions as an [Issue in the GitHub repository](https://github.com/UrbanInstitute/education-data-package-r/issues) for the development team.

Installation
------------

To install `educationdata`:

-   Install the `devtools` package if you don't already have it, and run:

``` r
# install.packages('devtools') # if necessary
devtools::install_github('UrbanInstitute/education-data-package-r')
```

Usage
-----

``` r
library(educationdata)

df <- get_education_data(level = 'schools', 
                         source = 'ccd', 
                         topic = 'enrollment', 
                         by = list('race', 'sex'),
                         filters = list(year = 2008,
                                        grade = 9:12,
                                        ncessch = '340606000122'),
                         add_labels = TRUE)

```

The `get_education_data()` function will return a `data.frame` from a call to the Education Data API.

``` r
get_education_data(level, source, topic, by, filters, add_labels)
```

where:

-   level (required) - API data level to query.
-   source (requried) - API data source to query.
-   topic (required) - API data topic to query.
-   by (optional) - Optional `list` of grouping parameters for an API call.
-   filters (optional) - Optional `list` query to filter the results from an API call.
-   add\_labels - Add variable labels (when applicable)? Defaults to `FALSE`.

Main Filters
------------

Due to the way the API is set-up, the variables listed within 'main filters' are the fastest way to subset an API call.

In addition to `year`, the other main filters for certain endpoints accept the following values:

### Grade

| Filter Argument      | Grade            |
|----------------------|------------------|
| `grade = 'grade-pk'` | Pre-K            |
| `grade = 'grade-k'`  | Kindergarten     |
| `grade = 'grade-1'`  | Grade 1          |
| `grade = 'grade-2'`  | Grade 2          |
| `grade = 'grade-3'`  | Grade 3          |
| `grade = 'grade-4'`  | Grade 4          |
| `grade = 'grade-5'`  | Grade 5          |
| `grade = 'grade-6'`  | Grade 6          |
| `grade = 'grade-7'`  | Grade 7          |
| `grade = 'grade-8'`  | Grade 8          |
| `grade = 'grade-9'`  | Grade 9          |
| `grade = 'grade-10'` | Grade 10         |
| `grade = 'grade-11'` | Grade 11         |
| `grade = 'grade-12'` | Grade 12         |
| `grade = 'grade-13'` | Grade 13         |
| `grade = 'grade-14'` | Adult Education  |
| `grade = 'grade-15'` | Ungraded         |
| `grade = 'grade-16'` | K-12             |
| `grade = 'grade-20'` | Grades 7 and 8   |
| `grade = 'grade-21'` | Grade 9 and 10   |
| `grade = 'grade-22'` | Grades 11 and 12 |
| `grade = 'grade-99'` | Total            |

### Level of Study

| Filter Argument                         | Level of Study     |
|-----------------------------------------|--------------------|
| `level_of_study = 'undergraduate'`      | Undergraduate      |
| `level_of_study = 'graduate'`           | Graduate           |
| `level_of_study = 'first-professional'` | First Professional |
| `level_of_study = 'post-baccalaureate'` | Post-baccalaureate |
| `level_of_study = '99'`                 | Total              |

Examples
--------

Let's build up some examples, from the following set of endpoints.

| Level   | Source | Topic      | By        | Main Filters | Years Available |
|:--------|:-------|:-----------|:----------|:-------------|:----------------|
| schools | ccd    | enrollment | NA        | year, grade  | 1987-2014       |
| schools | ccd    | enrollment | race      | year, grade  | 1987-2014       |
| schools | ccd    | enrollment | race, sex | year, grade  | 1987-2014       |
| schools | ccd    | enrollment | sex       | year, grade  | 1987-2014       |

The following will return a `data.frame` across all years and grades:

``` r
library(educationdata)
df <- get_education_data(level = 'schools', 
                         source = 'ccd', 
                         topic = 'enrollment')
```

Note that this endpoint is also callable `by` certain variables:

-   race
-   sex
-   race, sex

These variables can be added to the `by` argument:

``` r
df <- get_education_data(level = 'schools', 
                         source = 'ccd', 
                         topic = 'enrollment', 
                         by = list('race', 'sex'))
```

You may also filter the results of an API call. In this case `year` and `grade` will provide the most time-efficient subsets, and can be vectorized:

``` r
df <- get_education_data(level = 'schools', 
                         source = 'ccd', 
                         topic = 'enrollment', 
                         by = list('race', 'sex'),
                         filters = list(year = 1988:1990,
                                        grade = 6:8))
```

Additional variables can also be passed to `filters` to subset further:

``` r
df <- get_education_data(level = 'schools', 
                         source = 'ccd', 
                         topic = 'enrollment', 
                         by = list('race', 'sex'),
                         filters = list(year = 1988:1990,
                                        grade = 6:8,
                                        ncessch = '010000200277'))
```

Finally, the `add_labels` flag will map variables to a `factor` from their labels in the API.

``` r
df <- get_education_data(level = 'schools', 
                         source = 'ccd', 
                         topic = 'enrollment', 
                         by = list('race', 'sex'),
                         filters = list(year = 1988:1990,
                                        grade = 6:8,
                                        ncessch = '010000200277'),
                         add_labels = TRUE)
```
